# ATDRP_Project
# 🛡️ Automated Threat Detection & Response 

This simulates real-world cloud security incidents and demonstrates automated threat detection and response using AWS-native services. Infrastructure is provisioned with Terraform and integrates GuardDuty, AWS Config, Security Hub, CloudTrail, and Lambda.

> ⚙️ Designed as a portfolio project to showcase hands-on cloud security and DevSecOps engineering skills.

## Project Configuration Overview
This project includes setup and configuration for key AWS services to build a secure, scalable, and event-driven architecture.

1️⃣ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Creates a logically isolated network in AWS with subnets, route tables, and internet gateways to host resources securely.

2️⃣ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Launches virtual servers to run applications, with customizable instance types, security groups, and key pairs.

3️⃣ SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Sets up a messaging service to send alerts or notifications via email, SMS, or other endpoints.

4️⃣ GuardDuty

Enables intelligent threat detection to monitor AWS accounts and workloads for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.

5️⃣ Lambda

Configures serverless functions that run code in response to events, such as SNS messages or CloudWatch alarms.

6️⃣ IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Defines roles, policies, and permissions to securely control access to AWS resources.

7️⃣ CloudWatch

Monitors logs, metrics, and events from AWS services to enable observability and automated responses.

### 🚨 Lambda Auto-Remediation – CloudWatch Logs
Lambda function is triggered automatically and removes ingress rules from the compromised EC2 instance.

### 🔒 Quarantined EC2 Instance – Tag & Isolation
EC2 instance is tagged with `Quarantine=True` and its security group ingress rules are revoked.
